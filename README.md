### Project Description
Climate change denialism is a socially disruptive behavior that has plagued environmental reform for decades. The underlying causes of this irrational belief have been speculated on and tested repeatedly with no firm consensus having been reached. While researchers have found correlations between an individualâ€™s experiential weather and their opinions of the existence of climate change, much of this work has been based on smaller-scale, point-in-time studies. We seek to advance the understanding of climate change denial by incorporating local weather data into a large dataset collected by a nationally representative longitudinal survey of climate change opinions. To do so, we build a predictive model of believing in climate change based on the demographic and experiential weather patterns of survey respondents in the US between 2008 and 2022.

### Running the code
